# bounty

Major companies like Google [offer monetary rewards](http://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/) if you find bugs in their software.
These programs are often called "bug bounties."

We'll set up a bug bounty system in this course.
For every mistake that you find and correct in this course material, I will give you extra credit.
For example:

1. If you find a typo on any page, then create a pull request that fixes the typo.
Your first fix will be worth 5 points, and each subsequent fix worth a little less.

2. If part of a homework assignment is worded unclearly, then create a pull request that fixes the wording.

3. If you post a particularly nice question/answer to the issues section of this github repo, I will give you 5 points extra credit.
Questions need to be presented clearly, well researched, and interesting to get this extra credit.

4. If you discover a way to change your grade without me finding out, let me know.
You won't get in trouble.
I'll give up to 200 points extra credit for this, depending on how clever/severe your attack is.


Those are just examples.
If you can think of other ways to improve the course, let me know!
