# lab instructions

Each lab is worth 10 points towards your final grade.
If you complete the work during lab, you will get full credit.
If you do not finish during lab, you can show it to your TA during office hours for 8/10 points.
If you show up to lab late, you will get -5 points.

Labs 0 and 1 are to be completed individually.
Every other lab is to be completed using [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
That means you MUST work with a partner;
if you work alone, you will get a 0 on the lab.
If there is an odd number of people in lab, there should be ONE group of three.
You are not allowed to work with the same partner twice;
every week you should be working with someone different.
